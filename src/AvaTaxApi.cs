        /// involve a marketplace of vendors, each of which contributes some portion of the final transaction. Within
        /// a MultiDocument transaction, each individual buyer and seller pair are matched up and converted to a separate

        /// The `RefundTransaction` API allows you to quickly and easily create a `ReturnInvoice` representing a refund
        /// for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction. You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
        /// specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.
        /// 
        /// The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
        /// was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
        /// nexus, or any other setting.
        /// 
        /// This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following

        /// * A full refund of a previous sale
        /// * Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
        /// * Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
        /// * Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale
        /// 
        /// For more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to
        /// create a custom refund transaction.
